## Accessing the Frontend

To access the frontend of the project, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure the backend server is running. If you haven't set up the backend yet, please refer to the "SetUp Instruction" section for instructions on how to do it.

2. Open your web browser and enter the following URL:
http://localhost:3000/


Note: The above URL assumes that the frontend is running on the default port 3000. If you have configured a different port, replace `3000` with the correct port number.

3. You should now be able to view and interact with the frontend of the project.
